## Background

Our dashboard visualizes North American and global sales and
sales-related data, such as top publishers and top genres based on sales
and market share based on sales by year. More in details in our
[proposal](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/video_game_sales_dashboard/blob/main/doc/proposal.md).

## What are we doing?

Electronic video games in 2020 generated a revenue of around $165
billion. To thrive in this competitive industry, video game companies
have sales analysts who need to keep their eyes on stats relating to
sales. We built this simple dashboard to provide visual aids for the
sales analysts and to save their time on data wrangling for regional and
yearly data.

## Dashboard Description

![demo](./src/fig/demo.gif) Figure 1. Overview of the dashboard
</p>

The dashboard contains a landing page that by default shows the North
America sales line plot for PlayStation4, top publishers in the most
recent years available in the data set, top genres for the most recent
available year, a chart shows market share of the major players in the
industry in the most recent available year and an average critic score
of games on different platform in the most recent available year in the
data set. On the top of the page, a user can use the tabs to navigate
between the North America and global sales to show sales trends in North
America and the sales trend globally (under the `Global` tab). Moreover,
a user can use the year slider under the sales line plot to choose the
range of years of sales he/she would like to view from 2013. From the
filter on the side bar, a user can choose to show sales of different
companies, PS4 and/or Xbox. In addition, a user can also use the drop
down menus on the side bar to choose the year of top publishers, top
genres, market share and average critic score he/she would like to view.
At the bottom of the `Top Genre` and `Top Publisher` charts, a user can
choose how many top genres or publishers he/she want to see from 5 to 9.

## Future development

We are calling for developers to help us improve the existing features
